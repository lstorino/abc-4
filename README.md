# abc-4
The acid-binding capacity (ABC) of feed ingredients is crucial in piglet nutrition because it influences stomach pH, which plays a key role in digestion, enzyme activity, and pathogen control.
1. Supports Stomach Acidification
Piglets have an immature digestive system with limited hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. Ingredients with a high ABC require more acid to lower the stomach pH, which can delay optimal digestion. A low ABC diet helps maintain an acidic environment, promoting better digestion and nutrient absorption.
2. Enhances Protein Digestion
Pepsin, the primary enzyme for protein digestion, functions best at a low pH (below 3.5). If the ABC is too high, the stomach pH remains elevated, leading to poor protein digestion and reduced growth performance.
3. Reduces Pathogenic Bacteria Growth
An acidic stomach environment helps control harmful bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella, which thrive at higher pH levels. Feed ingredients with lower ABC help maintain a more acidic gut environment, reducing the risk of diarrhea and improving gut health.
4. Improves Feed Efficiency and Growth Performance. A diet with a balanced ABC ensures efficient digestion, better nutrient absorption, and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR). High ABC can lead to poor growth rates due to inefficient digestion.
